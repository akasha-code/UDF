## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Standardization
- Consistent project structure across teams
- Standardized deployment processes
- Common tooling and practices

### ðŸ“¦ Reusability
- Template-driven development
- Shared components and modules
- Pre-built examples and patterns

### ðŸš€ Efficiency
- Reduced setup time
- Automated workflows
- Best practices built-in

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- Comprehensive guides and references
- Real-world examples
- Community-contributed content

## Who Should Use UDF?

UDF is designed for:

- **Development Teams** - Standardize processes and improve collaboration
- **DevOps Engineers** - Streamline deployment and infrastructure management
- **Project Managers** - Ensure consistent delivery practices
