## I

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

A system that distributes network traffic across multiple servers.

### Logging
Recording events and messages from an application for debugging and monitoring.

## M

### Microservices
An architectural style where applications are composed of small, independent services.

### Middleware
Software that acts as a bridge between different applications or components.

### Migration
The process of moving data or applications from one environment to another.

### Monitoring
Continuously observing system performance and health.

### Monolith
An application built as a single, unified unit.

## N

### Namespace
A way to organize and isolate resources in systems like Kubernetes.

### Node
A physical or virtual machine in a cluster.

## O

### Observability
The ability to understand system internal state from external outputs (metrics, logs, traces).

### Orchestration
Automated configuration, coordination, and management of systems.

## P

### Pipeline
A series of automated steps for building, testing, and deploying code.

### Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

### Production
The live environment where end users access the application.

### Pull Request (PR)
A method of submitting changes to a codebase for review.

## Q

### Quality Gate
A checkpoint in the delivery pipeline that ensures quality standards are met.

## R

### Rate Limiting
Controlling the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.

### Readiness Probe
A check to determine if a service is ready to accept traffic.
